# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using a Jupyter Notebook. The system is designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and historical data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the recommendation engine provides personalized suggestions, enhancing the user experience.

## Dataset
The dataset includes user ratings, movie details, and metadata to build the recommendation system. Key components of the dataset are:
- **User Ratings**: Numerical scores given by users for movies.
- **Movie Metadata**: Includes genre, cast, director, and descriptions, which help in content-based filtering.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gained insights into user behavior, movie trends, and the popularity of specific genres or actors.
- **Recommendation Techniques**:
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes movie characteristics (genre, actors, etc.) to recommend movies similar to the ones a user likes.
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on the preferences of similar users, leveraging user-item interaction data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated recommendation performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) for collaborative filtering and accuracy metrics for content-based recommendations.

## Features
1. **User Personalization**: Delivers movie recommendations tailored to individual user preferences.
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for improved recommendation accuracy.
3. **Interactive Visualizations**: Uses visualizations to explore movie trends, user behavior, and recommendation quality.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `surprise` (for collaborative filtering)

Install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn surprise
## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MovieRecommendationSystem.git

   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd MovieRecommendationSystem
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Movie\ Recommendation\ System.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results
The recommendation system is tested on sample data, providing relevant and accurate movie suggestions. The system demonstrates strong performance in understanding user preferences and delivering meaningful recommendations.
